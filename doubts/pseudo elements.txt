A pseudo-element in CSS is a keyword added to a selector that allows you to style a specific part of an element or create a virtual element that doesnâ€™t exist in the document tree. Pseudo-elements enable you to apply styles without modifying the HTML structure.

Common Pseudo-elements:

::before: Inserts content before the content of an element.
::after: Inserts content after the content of an element.
::first-line: Styles the first line of a block of text.
::first-letter: Styles the first letter of a block of text.
::placeholder: Styles the placeholder text in an input field.
::selection: Styles the portion of text that has been selected by the user.

Usage Example: (css)
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold; /* Makes the first line of a paragraph bold */
}

Pseudo-elements enhance the styling capabilities of CSS by allowing specific portions of elements to be targeted without altering the HTML markup.
